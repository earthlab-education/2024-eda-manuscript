Hopefully it is csv data that already has month and day of month values delimited!

Use Python in Jupyter Notebook to create a for loop to import/append data into a single dataframe that contains all the data, parsing the year info from the filename. The resultant product would be a pandas dataframe with columns ""year"", ""month"", ""day_of_month"", and ""temperature_deg_f"". 

Next I would make a new dataframe series for ""temperature_deg_c"" by using a conversion factor.

The last processing step would be to make a dataframe object using groupby ""month"" with a .mean() calculation on the temperature_deg_c.

Then I would just plot that dataframe object as a line plot with month as the x axis and mean temp deg c as the y and add a marker symbol for each month.
